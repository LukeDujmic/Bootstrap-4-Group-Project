            Konami is particularly known for developing classic video game franchises like Metal Gear and Castlevania, but there is another iconic game in their lineup that people didn’t even know that the company owned when it was released in 1981, and that game is called Frogger.
            <br>
            <br>
            In Frogger, one player takes control of a frog who is trying to cross the road from the bottom to the top, but getting to the top is not that easy, as the frog would need to avoid moving cars and try to hop on the back of turtles or on logs of wood without touching the water on the river. As the player progresses in Frogger, the levels will get harder and harder, with cars moving much faster than before, logs having snakes that can kill the frog in one hit, and crocodiles appearing on the river to stop the frog from reaching the finish line.
            <br>
            <br>
            Frogger was one of the first games that incorporated difficulty spikes in gaming, and because of this innovation, many games today feature rising and spiking difficulty to challenge players to get better. To know more about road-crossing video games, here is a brief history of Frogger.

        <article class="historyText">
            In 1981, a video game developer for Konami named Akira Hashimoto got the concept for Frogger when he was in his car and waiting for the traffic light to turn green. During his wait, he saw a frog trying to cross to the other side of the road.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, the frog was having difficulty crossing the road because of the vehicles that were passing through. Hashimoto then stopped his car on the side of the road and carried the frog to reach the other side. After helping the frog, the idea for Frogger immediately came to Hashimoto’s mind.

        <article class="historyText">
            Hashimoto worked on developing Frogger and presented it to the executives at Konami. The company then showed it to Gremlin, which is a video game publisher that was acquired by Sega in 1978. Gremlin didn’t like the game at first, mainly because they believed that video games starring a frog as the protagonist wouldn’t sell well, and they already tried the concept for a game called Frogs that was released in 1978.
            <br>
            <br>
            It would take a couple of weeks before Elizabeth Falconer, a market researcher for Gremlin, found Frogger in their library and suggested that it should be published. Falconer then learned that Gremlin executives rejected it, saying that the gameplay for Frogger is too “basic” and too “cute” for boys to play. Despite being rejected the first time, Falconer insisted that Frogger should be given a second chance.
